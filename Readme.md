# Bagman

Add a bag of attributes to ActiveRecord models.

We built Bagman for a project. We wanted fast prototyping and development, and some level of escape from the schema on relational databases.

It works by serialising and deserialising a JSON string to a `text` field in the database.

Deep getters and setters are provided by `AngryHash`.
